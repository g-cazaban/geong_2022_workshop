## Conducting data treatment and analysis using QGIS Graphical Modeler

Via an exercise centered on an environmental dataset, this 1h30 workshop aims at discovering and learning to use the graphical modeler of QGIS. If it does not compete with an ETL software, the graphical modeler of QGIS allows to set up processing chains intuitively to automate data analysis. This workshop is best suited to people with preexisting basic experience of QGIS as well as basic knowledge of spatial processes. Yet, everybody is welcome to join as the aim of the workshop is also to take a step back on analytical aspects and take a step by step approach with the graphical modeler.

Technical requirements: all participants will need access to a laptop that runs QGIS â€“ we recommend the latest long term version of the software (3.22).
