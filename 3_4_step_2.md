## Step 2: Algorithms

Second part of a model is the workflow, it will includes **algorithms** for data process, and finally one or more **outputs**. Here we will focus on the algorithms.

### **Add alogrithm**

We will add the algorithm *Count points in polygons* - this way we'll aggregate our fire *by* administrative division
