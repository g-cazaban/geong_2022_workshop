## What's next?


After this introduction to models in the QGIS graphical modeler, you can continue working on more advanced models that fit your needs. 

Here are some model functions that are still to be explored:
- Batch process
- Iteration
- Dependencies


### Python Script export

Sometimes, algorithms and available process in the graphical modeler won't fit your needs. For example algorithms are limited to manage symbology and to export map. 

In this case, **you can always export the model as Python script** and enhance it directly in Python. Note that the script can also be exported as it is and be associated to a *QGIS server*.


### Next development in the Graphical Modeler

Recent crowdfunding launched by [North Road](https://north-road.com/) and funded will focus next development to expand the capabilities and flexibility of Processing and the Processing Model Designer! Take a look at those development [here](https://north-road.com/processing_crowdfunding/).
