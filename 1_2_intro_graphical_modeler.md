## QGIS Graphical Modeler

The graphical modeler allows you to create complex models using a simple and easy-to-use interface. When working with a GIS, most analysis operations are not isolated, rather part of a chain of operations. Using the graphical modeler, that chain of operations can be wrapped into a single process, making it convenient to execute later with a different set of inputs. No matter how many steps and different algorithms it involves, a model is executed as a single algorithm, saving time and effort. 


### QGIS vs ETL

Creating model, data workflow directly in QGIS is the main asset of the graphical modeler. It does not required any scripting knowledege, nor third party tool or other licence. 

However, **it is sometimes limited compared to other ETL** such as [FME](https://www.safe.com/) or [Talend](https://www.talend.com/), its open-source version.

Finally, for people used to development languages, writing in **Python** or **R** can replace the use of the graphical modeler.
