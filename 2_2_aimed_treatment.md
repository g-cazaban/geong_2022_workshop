## Aimed treatment

During this workshop we are aiming to create **our first model**, and then try to enrich it a bit to make it more accurate and specific to our needs.
We will learn how to:

- *Create a model*
- *Manage inputs*
- *Use algorithm for basic spatial analysis*
- *Manage date as input*
- *Create attributes*

Here we will  create a **“one-shot” model**, but the idea behind is to create something **reusable**. As the data we’ll be using is really stable, **we can imagine that our model can be run with another export in the future or in another area**.
