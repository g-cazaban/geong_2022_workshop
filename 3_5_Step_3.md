## Step 3: Outputs

Second part of a model is the workflow, it will includes **algorithms** for data process, and finally one or more **outputs**. Here we will focus on the outputs.

### **Add an output**

To create an output, we need to say which process will give the model outputs, in our case we only have one algorithm.

To set the analysis as output, you only have to put a name close to the output option.
